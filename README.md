# Symantica

**Symantica** (pronounced *sim-AN-ti-ka*) is a **semantic compiler for analytics and BI**.

It compiles **metric definitions and analytical behaviors** into a deterministic **query plan and view model**, which can be rendered into multiple dashboard runtimes.

## What this is
- A metric-first semantic layer
- A behavior orchestration framework
- Tool-agnostic BI infrastructure

## What this is not
- A no-code dashboard builder
- An AI-generated analytics replacement
- A visualization library
